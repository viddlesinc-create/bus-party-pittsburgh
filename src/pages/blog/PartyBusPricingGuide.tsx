      <h2>Average Party Bus Rental Prices in Pittsburgh</h2>
      <p>
        In Pittsburgh, party bus rental rates typically range from $100 to $300 per hour, depending on the vehicle 
        size and amenities. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small Party Buses (10-15 passengers):</strong> $100-$150 per hour</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Party Buses (16-25 passengers):</strong> $150-$200 per hour</li>
        <li><strong>Large Party Buses (26-40 passengers):</strong> $200-$300 per hour</li>
        <li><strong>Luxury/Premium Buses:</strong> $250-$400+ per hour</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Factors That Affect Party Bus Pricing</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Group Size and Vehicle Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        The number of passengers directly impacts the price. Larger vehicles cost more to operate and maintain, 
        resulting in higher hourly rates. However, the per-person cost often decreases with larger groups, making 
        it more economical for bigger parties.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Rental Duration</h3>
      <p>
        Most party bus companies in Pittsburgh have minimum rental periods, typically 3-4 hours. While hourly rates 
        remain consistent, many companies offer discounted rates for full-day rentals or extended bookings.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Day of the Week and Time</h3>
      <p>
        Weekend rentals, especially Friday and Saturday nights, command premium pricing. Weekday rentals can be 
        20-30% less expensive. Peak hours (evening and night) may also have higher rates than daytime rentals.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Seasonality</h3>
      <p>
        Pittsburgh's party bus prices fluctuate throughout the year:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Peak Season (April-October):</strong> Highest demand for weddings, proms, and outdoor events</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday Season (November-December):</strong> Increased rates for holiday parties and New Year's Eve</li>
        <li><strong>Off-Season (January-March):</strong> Best deals and more availability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Amenities and Features</h3>
      <p>
        Premium features add to the cost but enhance the experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>State-of-the-art sound systems</li>
        <li>LED lighting and dance floors</li>
        <li>Bar areas and coolers</li>
        <li>Flat-screen TVs and entertainment systems</li>
        <li>Leather seating and luxury interiors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Costs to Consider</h2>
      
      <h3>Gratuity and Service Charges</h3>
      <p>
        Most companies automatically include 15-20% gratuity for the driver. Some may add service fees or fuel 
        surcharges, so always ask for a detailed quote that includes all costs.
      </p>

      <h3>Overtime Charges</h3>
      <p>
        Running over your scheduled time typically results in prorated hourly charges. These rates may be higher 
        than your contracted hourly rate, so plan your schedule carefully.
      </p>

      <h3>Cleaning Fees</h3>
      <p>
        Excessive mess or damage may result in additional cleaning fees ranging from $100-$500. Most companies 
        include standard cleaning in the base price.
      </p>

      <h2>Money-Saving Tips for Party Bus Rentals</h2>
      
      <h3>Book Early</h3>
      <p>
        Reserve your party bus 2-3 months in advance for the best rates and vehicle selection. Last-minute bookings 
        often come with premium pricing.
      </p>

      <h3>Consider Off-Peak Times</h3>
      <p>
        Weekday events or Sunday rentals can save you 20-30% compared to prime Friday and Saturday nights.
      </p>

      <h3>Share Costs with Your Group</h3>
      <p>
        When split among passengers, party bus rentals are often more affordable than individual transportation 
        options like rideshares or taxis.
      </p>

      <h3>Bundle Services</h3>
      <p>
        Some companies offer package deals for multiple vehicles or extended rental periods. Ask about discounts 
        for booking both transportation and other services.
      </p>

      <h3>Be Flexible with Your Date</h3>
      <p>
        If your event date is flexible, ask about availability during less busy periods to secure better rates.
      </p>
