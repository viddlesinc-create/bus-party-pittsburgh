      <h2>Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>

      <h3>Group Size</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Party Bus Wins:</strong> If your group exceeds 12 people, a party bus provides better 
        value and comfort. Everyone has space to move around and socialize freely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limo Wins:</strong> For groups of 10 or fewer seeking intimate luxury, a limousine 
        offers the perfect setting without excess space.
      </p>

      <h3>Event Type</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Party Bus Wins:</strong> High-energy celebrations like bachelor parties, birthday bashes, 
        and concert outings benefit from the party bus atmosphere. The ability to stand, dance, and move 
        freely keeps energy high.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limo Wins:</strong> Formal events like weddings, corporate functions, and romantic 
        occasions call for the sophistication a limousine provides.
      </p>

      <h3>Entertainment Value</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Party Bus Wins:</strong> With dance floors, extensive sound systems, and entertainment 
        features, party buses turn transportation into part of the event itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limo Wins:</strong> When conversation and intimate gathering matter more than dancing 
        and loud music, limousines provide the right atmosphere.
      </p>

      <h3>Cost per Person</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Party Bus Wins:</strong> For larger groups, the cost per person is typically lower with 
        a party bus, despite higher total rental costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limo Wins:</strong> Smaller groups often find limousines more economical, with lower 
        total rental costs that don't need to be split among as many people.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Party Bus Wins:</strong> Modern party buses often include wheelchair accessibility and 
        ADA-compliant features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limo Wins:</strong> Lower profile makes entering and exiting easier, especially in 
        formal wear or for guests with mobility considerations.
      </p>

      <h2>Making Your Decision</h2>

      <h3>Choose a Party Bus If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your group has 15 or more people</li>
        <li>You want to dance and move around</li>
        <li>Energy and fun are top priorities</li>
        <li>You're visiting multiple venues</li>
        <li>Restroom facilities are important</li>
        <li>You want the journey to be part of the party</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Choose a Limousine If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your group has 12 or fewer people</li>
        <li>Elegance and sophistication matter most</li>
        <li>You prefer intimate conversation</li>
        <li>The event is formal or romantic</li>
        <li>You're making a grand entrance</li>
        <li>Traditional luxury is your priority</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can't Decide? Consider Both!</h2>
      <p>
        For large weddings, consider using both vehicles: a limousine for the bride and groom, and a party 
        bus for the bridal party. This combination provides everyone with the appropriate experience while 
        keeping the entire group coordinated.
      </p>

      <h2>Pittsburgh-Specific Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Pittsburgh's diverse venues and events often determine the best choice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>South Side bar hopping:</strong> Party bus handles multiple stops better</li>
        <li><strong>Downtown galas:</strong> Limousine provides elegant venue arrival</li>
        <li><strong>Stadium events:</strong> Party bus accommodates larger groups</li>
        <li><strong>Romantic dinners:</strong> Limousine enhances the intimate experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        Both party buses and limousines offer luxury transportation with unique advantages. Your choice 
        should reflect your group size, event type, and celebration style. Consider your priorities - 
        whether that's maximum fun, classic elegance, or practical accommodation - and select the vehicle 
        that best delivers on those goals. Check our <Link to="/pricing" className="text-primary hover:underline">party bus pricing in Pittsburgh</Link> for
